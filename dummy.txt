Overview
The YAML Rule Engine is a flexible, extensible, and developer-friendly validation framework built with Java + Spring Boot. It externalizes validation logic from hardcoded Java classes into declarative YAML files, allowing teams to:

Define reusable, readable validation rules.

Assign rules to fields dynamically per use case.

Compose rules using logical operators (AND, OR, NOT).

Use Java-based rules with parameters defined in YAML.

Apply validations against request payloads and fallback to database values when needed.

Capture both hard errors and warnings in a single pass.

Problems It Solves

| Challenge                           | Solution Provided                            |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Hardcoded validations               | YAML-based, externalized, configurable rules |
| Repeated logic for multiple fields  | Reusable rule definitions (`validation.yml`) |
| Complex conditions and combinations | Logical operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`)       |
| Partial fallbacks from DB           | Rule context supports fallback to DB model   |
| Messy error handling                | Aggregated HARD and WARNING errors           |
| Rule extensibility                  | Java classes registered automatically        |

[Engine] ➤ Validating field: age
[Engine]    → OR combination detected
[Engine]       ↪ Evaluating rule: ageCheck → ❌ FAILED (HARD)
[Engine]       ↪ Evaluating rule: ageFallbackCheck → ❌ FAILED (HARD)
[Engine]    → OR result = ❌ FAILED
[Engine]    → Collecting HARD error: age = Age is too young

[Engine] ➤ Validating field: name
[Engine]    → AND combination detected
[Engine]       ↪ Evaluating rule: requiredCheck → ❌ FAILED (HARD)
[Engine]       ↪ Evaluating rule: maxLengthCheck → ✅ PASSED
[Engine]       ↪ Evaluating rule: noSpecialCharCheck → ⚠️ WARNING
[Engine]    → AND result = ❌ FAILED
[Engine]    → Collecting HARD error: name = Name is required
[Engine]    → Collecting WARNING: name = Name has special characters

[Engine] ➤ Validating field: platformName
[Engine]    → Evaluating rule: platformNameCheck → ❌ FAILED (HARD)
[Engine]    → Collecting HARD error: platformName = Invalid platform




Pros
✅ Externalized & human-readable rules

✅ Logical operators and composition

✅ Auto-wiring of new rule classes

✅ Built-in SpEL for dynamic expressions

✅ Supports both payload and DB fallback

✅ Accumulates all errors (no short-circuiting)
